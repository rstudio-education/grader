\title{Grading Demo}
\usage{
grading_demo()
}
\description{
If you are using the RStudio IDE, \code{grading_demo()} opens an example learnr
file that demonstrates how to use the grader package to check student code.
}
\details{
The tutorial sets the learnr exercise. checker option to
\code{grade_learnr()} in the document's setup chunk. It then uses
\code{check_code()} to check the single exercise in the tutorial. To use
\code{check_code()}, follow the exercise chunk with a chunk whose label
matches the label of the exercise chunk but includes the suffix
\code{-check}. Call \code{check_code()} in that chunk. To ensure that
\code{check_code()} can provide formative feedback, also provide the
solution code in a chunk suffixed \code{-solution}.

If you are not using RStudio IDE, you can access the demo file at \code{system.file("extdata", "grading-demo/grading-demo.Rmd", package = "grader")}.
