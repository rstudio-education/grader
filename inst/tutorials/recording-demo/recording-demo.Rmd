Here is a number. You can do great things with it, like this:  

* Take the square root of the log of the number. Then click Submit Answer.

```{r number, exercise = TRUE}
1
```

```{r number-hint-1}
"You can take the log with `log()`"
```

```{r number-hint-2}
"You can take the square root with `sqrt()`"
```

```{r number-solution}
sqrt(log(1))
```

```{r number-check}
check_code("Good job. Don't worry, things will soon get harder.")
```
